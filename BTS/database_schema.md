In our web APi we are using Mango DB as our Database. We have 3 Schemas: UserSchema, TypeSchema, and PropertySchema.

The User could be a Student or a Landlord. The landlord have access to add property and delete one. The student could see the properties and like them if he/she wants.

The Schemas are available in web Api folder.
