## What has been achieved:
- A database has been created
- Methods to communicate with the database have been implemented and tested

## To be accomplished:
- As a landlord, I want to be able to create a post, so that students can see it
- As a student, I want to be able to search over properties, so that I can choose a place to rent

## For BTS630:
- As a student, I want to save multiple properties, so that I can check them later
- As a student, I want to message the landlord, so that I can book a view
