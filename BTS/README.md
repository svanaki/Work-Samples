## Project Description 
The main goal of our platform is connecting landlords to students who are looking for housing in an easy and swift manner.
	
We understand that landlords want to increase their exposure to as many students from around the area (or even the country). We also understand students are trying to find the most affordable and accessible housing. Using our service, you as a landlord can list your properties and incorporate an additional revenue stream into your business. You can directly market to your target audience without any fee, no hurdles to jump through, and no wondering if your ads are being seen or not. In comparison to rental agencies, our services will be designed to be intuitive, and simple to use. We understand that your business doesn’t need another hurdle when it comes to connecting with students, which is why landlords who use our service will be amazed about the ease of ad placement, simplicity of student communication, and multi-school connectivity.

Using our service, instead of wasting time through conventional sites that have rentals listed all over a city, you as a student will be able to browse through selected rentals all around your college or university and save hours over using other sites. Connecting with the homeowner will be easier than ever before.

- For Landlords: 
	1. Each ad should contain detailed information on the best way to get in touch with a landlord, whether it’s through email, phone, or even text. Landlords posting their property would need various entities such as address (street name and number, street type, city, state and zip code), type of accommodation, the price of the rental, lease types offered and conditions, information required from the tenant by the landlord, landlord contact information, pictures of the property/room, a description of the amenities of the rental and school landlord is trying to target his/her property at.

- For Students:
	1. You can browse by province and school. Or for more control use the search feature:
	2. Start by selecting a university or college that you’re interested in.
	3. Then filter by your price range to explore an extensive list of possibilities.
	4. Finally, filter the results by date so you can choose the right start time for you!
	
## Project API
The Google Maps Platform(https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) will be one of the main api's used on the web pplication to showcase the location of properties to students and how close the peroperties are to their school of choice. In addition, a database api whether through mongoDB or Postgress is needed to store the contents of the web application. Functionality for CRUD operations will be present in the web application for the property owners and search functionality will be a key aspect for students using the web app.
