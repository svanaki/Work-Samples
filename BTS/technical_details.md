## Back-End

For the server, we will be using Node.js with Express.js. Express is a framework that makes it easy to create REST APIs by allowing us to define code that runs for different requests on the server. It is a routing library for responding to server requests and building REST APIs. Node is the actual server running the JavaScript code. MongoDB is our first choice of the database but we are studying firebase as well to see if we could use it instead. Heroku will be hosting our service as a public-facing host. It relies on git.

## Front-End

We will be using Angular as a front-end. It is straightforward to create HTML templates that are dynamically filled with data and automatically updated whenever the data changes. It is very powerful and has a huge community and excellent documentation. Angular encourages the use of TypeScript.

## Developing Tools

Our website will be developed using the Visual Studio Code. Postman will be used to test several HTTP requests to decouple back-end and front-end tasks.
